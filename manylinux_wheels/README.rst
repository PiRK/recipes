The examples in this folder show how to generate manylinux wheels for python libraries, for 32-bit and 64-bit architectures, and for several versions of python (2.7, 3.4, 3.5).

The basic information you need to know about manylinux wheels, and using docker images to generate them, is summarized in manylinux.rst 

The scripts for the silx wheels can be used as a base for any python library that provides a setup.py file to build the wheels with ``pip wheel``.

The PyQt4 example shows how to generate a wheel *manually* from an installed library, including non-python dependencies.
SIP, Qt4 and PyQt4 are downloaded, compiled and installed from sources. The wheel files are generated by gathering the required files in a zip archive, with the necessary metadata, as specified in `PEP 427 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0427/#file-name-convention>`_.
