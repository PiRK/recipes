The examples in this folder show how to generate manylinux wheels for python libraries, for 32-bit and 64-bit architectures, and for several versions of python (2.7, 3.4, 3.5).

The scripts for the silx wheels can be used as a base for any python library that provides a setup.py file to build the wheels with ``pip wheel``.

The PyQt4 example shows how to generate a wheel *manually* from an installed library, including non-python dependencies.
SIP, Qt4 and PyQt4 are downloaded, compiled and installed from sources. The wheel files are generated by gathering the required files in a zip archive, with the necessary metadata, as specified in `PEP 427 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0427/#file-name-convention>`_.
